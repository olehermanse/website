I participated in the DayKnights 30-day projects, Oct 15th to Nov 15th.
One week after the deadline, I am done with everything I wanted to do.
The game is by no means complete, but it's playable and challegning (sometimes).
I enjoyed making something new, and will probably continue working on this.
Maybe I'll post another update in a while.

The game is playable at:

Here is the project page:

And the source code is also available:

## Goals

Here are the goals I set for myself before starting:

### Week 1 - Basic HTML structure

- Resizable html canvas
- Basic drawing / grid

### Week 2 - Gameplay

- Placing towers
- Moving enemies
- Towers shooting enemies

### Week 3 - Interesting mechanics

- Collision / block enemies with towers
- Pathfinding for enemies to get around towers

### Week 4 - Polish

- Levels
- Points
- Artwork?

## Progress

Here is a story, told in GIFs:

## Ideas

Currently, the game feels quite good up until level 10.
After level 10, the player is snowballing, gaining a lot of money and can easily defeat the enemies.
There are some things I'd like to implement:

- More enemy types
- Increase difficulty after level 10
- Scaling difficulty
- Money-making towers
- Particle effects
- More interesting map with randomized walls
