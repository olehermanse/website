I've watched, and been a fan of, video game streamer [Sean "Day9" Plott](https://day9.tv) for many years.
Since he is now encouraging community members to do a 30-day project with him, I decided to join.
The goal is to stop procrastinating and focus on getting something done in 30 days.
Participants choose their own projects, and I've decided to work on a game.
If you're interested in joining or seeing the other projects, you can read more on [their discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/day9tv).

### Project description

Turn based RPG prototype.
I'm not starting completely from scratch, I have a basic battle system from earlier.
This month I will work on 4 "big" features for the game.

### Plan

The project is divided up into 4 weeks, each with separate tasks and focuses:

- **Week 1:** Experiment with UI and graphics.
- **Week 2:** Effects (Buffs and debuffs caused by skills)
- **Week 3:** Progression - levelling, unlocking skills
- **Week 4:** Content - Add more skills, enemies, "dungeons". Finish loose ends for a playable demo/prototype.

The project is running from April 4th to May 4th.
Since I joined a few days late, I will allow some additional time for week 1.

### Progress

The game project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/olehermanse/mrpg).
Anyone interested can follow along there, and I plan to put some updates here as well.
