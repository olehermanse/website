I write Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), at work and in my spare time.
Professionally I develop the [CFEngine](https://github.com/cfengine/core) C client, C backend/server, and tooling in Python 3.
In my spare time, I make websites, games and other neat things, in Rust, Python, and js/html/css.
I love video games, security and open source, and I also like to teach, write, and travel.
