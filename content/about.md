I am a programmer and security professional from Norway, with interests in software product security, privacy, systems programming, programming languages, open source software, game development, and photography.

## Work

At [Northern.tech](https://northern.tech/) I lead the security team and the CFEngine product team.
We work in the systems management field, developing an over-the-air software updater, [Mender](https://mender.io/), and a configuration management solution, [CFEngine](https://cfengine.com/).
Here are a few of the things I've worked on:

- I worked on the handling, customer communication, and public announcement of several CVEs:
  - In CFEngine: https://cfengine.com/tags/cve
  - In Mender: https://mender.io/blog/tag/cve
- I've written content / blog posts on varied topics, including security, features, releases, technical content marketing and similar:
  - [Handling security vulnerabilities in our products](https://northern.tech/careers/blog/handling-security-vulnerabilities-in-our-products)
  - [Open source at Northern.tech](https://northern.tech/careers/blog/open-source-at-northern-tech)
  - [Benefits of agent-based configuration management](https://cfengine.com/blog/2024/benefits-of-agents/).
  - [Comparing Ansible and CFEngine](https://cfengine.com/blog/2021/comparing-ansible-and-cfengine/).
  - [Christmas-themed security holiday calendar](https://cfengine.com/blog/2022/security-holiday-calendar-part-1/)
  - And many more blog posts which can be found [here](https://cfengine.com/author/ole-herman-elgesem/).
- I've worked on most parts of the C codebase for CFEngine Community (open source) and CFEngine Enterprise.
  - I introduced [custom promise types](https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.24/reference-promise-types-custom.html), with a protocol for implementing management of arbitrary resources in external modules which can be written in any programming language.
  - I overhauled the reporting system, removing the redis queue and fixed several consistency / error handling issues.
- I introduced and wrote large parts of new tools introduced to CFEngine:
  - [cfbs](https://github.com/cfengine/cfbs) - The command line tool for the CFEngine Build system
  - [cf-remote](https://github.com/cfengine/cf-remote) - CLI for spawning cloud VMs, downloading and installing CFEngine packages over SSH, and similar.
  - [CFEngine Zed extension](https://github.com/olehermanse/zed-cfengine) (and [tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/olehermanse/tree-sitter-cfengine)).

### Talks

- [Introduction to CFEngine Build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q00Eyf3E4Y)
- [Modernizing the CFEngine project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mREWIz2zqws)
- [CFToolkit: New tooling in CFEngine 3.10, 3.12, and beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q50_QTd1AN4)

## Side projects

In my spare time, I work on various open source websites, tools, games and other neat things, in Rust, Python, C, and in the browser (ts/js/css/html).
Here are a few notable ones:

- Games:
  - [towers](https://towers.oleherman.com) - A tower defense game in the browser.
  - [dagensquiz.no](https://dagensquiz.no) / [dailyquiz.app](https://dailyquiz.app) - Randomized quiz of the day.
  - [trpg](https://trpg.oleherman.com) - A browser-based black and white, turn based RPG / roguelike.
    - [mrpg](https://github.com/olehermanse/mrpg) was an earlier iteration of this concept, written in Python.
  - [tpg](https://tpg.oleherman.com) - Experimenting with multiplayer turn based games in the browser.
    For example Tic Tac Toe with 3 players, on a 7x7 board, with 4 in a row required to win.
- Electronics:
  - [ohm](https://github.com/olehermanse/ohm) - An easy way to draw circuit diagrams/schematics.
  - [schem](https://github.com/olehermanse/schem) - Simplistic electronics circuits for use in theses / papers.

## Open source contributions

Outside of the open source software I write at work, and the side projects mentioned above, I try to contribute to open source software:

- [pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Aolehermanse) - A windowing / media library for Python.
- [Hugo KISS theme](https://github.com/ribice/kiss/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aolehermanse) the theme I use for this website.
- [fui-kk](https://github.com/fui/fui-kk/commits?author=olehermanse) - Course evaluation software for student council at University of Oslo, department of informatics.
  We did a large upgrade when I was a student in 2016-2017, automating many manual steps, and improving the websites.
- And various smaller ones:
  - [Node.js website](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/7134)
  - [brew vagrant tap](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap/pull/300)
  - [hyper rust library](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/1791)
  - [Python (CPython)](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/136716)

I've also sponsored a few open source projects, including:

- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- [Python](https://github.com/python)
- [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter)
- [curl](https://github.com/bagder)
- [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew)
- [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon)
- [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio)

If you rely on the work of open source software authors, please consider donating to some of the projects you use.
